# Introduction 
##### Abstract
this project employs a multi-sensor approach, utilizing depth data, RGB data, NMEA data, and the Google API to facilitate dynamic navigation across diverse scenarios. Simultaneously, the system incorporates YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to not only identify but also quantify objects encountered along its traversed path. This integrated framework provides real-time insights by leveraging advanced computer vision techniques for object detection and counting.
